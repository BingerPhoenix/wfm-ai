# WFM.ai Demo Script (3 Minutes)

## Opening Hook (30 seconds)
**"What if your workforce planning could predict the future?"**

- Open to dashboard showing Tuesday
- **Point out**: "We're looking at a contact center handling 15K+ weekly contacts"
- **Highlight metrics**: "Currently running 25% AI deflection, 82% SLA"
- **The problem**: "Traditional WFM tools don't account for AI. This creates blind spots."

## Problem Demonstration (60 seconds)
### Step 1: Identify Coverage Gaps
**Ask WFM Copilot**: *"Where are my coverage gaps?"*

**Expected Response**: Shows Tuesday morning crisis
- "Tuesday 9-12 PM has severe understaffing (6-8 agent gap)"
- "Your SLA will drop to ~65% during these hours"
- Watch chart highlight red coverage gaps

**Key Point**: *"See how traditional planning missed this? The Tuesday surge is from system issues causing callback spikes."*

### Step 2: Show AI Impact
**Ask WFM Copilot**: *"What if deflection hits 35%?"*

**Expected Response**:
- Charts update in real-time
- Staffing requirement drops ~15%
- SLA improves to 89%
- Coverage gaps shrink dramatically

**Key Point**: *"10% deflection improvement = 8 fewer agents needed. That's $400K+ annual savings."*

## Solution Showcase (60 seconds)
### Feature Walkthrough
**Point to metrics updating**:

## Demo Tips
- **Keep moving**: Never spend more than 15 seconds on any single point
- **Use specific numbers**: "$400K savings", "8 fewer agents", "89% SLA"
- **Show, don't tell**: Let the animations and visual updates do the talking
- **Handle objections**: If asked about accuracy: "Our models are trained on 50+ contact centers"
- **End with urgency**: "Centers implementing AI-aware planning are seeing 20-30% efficiency gains"

## Backup Questions (If Time)
- "How does this compare to Verint/NICE?" → Show real-time AI adjustments
- "What about compliance?" → Point to explainable AI in Schedule Optimizer
- "Implementation timeline?" → "Most centers see value in first 30 days"

## Technical Notes
- Default view: Tuesday dashboard (shows biggest gaps)
- Ensure 35% deflection scenario pre-configured
- Have Coming Soon feature descriptions memorized
- Charts should update smoothly within 2 seconds of question
